If you haven't already done so, go download the pythag-starter.rkt file from the week 1 page. Use only the language you've learned so far to answer the question.

Assume that the two short sides of a right triangle have length 3 and 4. What is the length of the long side? Recall the Pythagorean Theorem tells us that:

length of the unknown side, ?, equals the square root of 3 squared plus 4 squared

In the pythag starter file, write a BSL expression that produces the value of ? for this triangle where the other two sides have lengths 3 and 4. Your expression shouldn't contain any numbers other than 3 and 4 (or in other words, all the math should be done in your expression, not in your head).

While writing your expression, focus specifically on formatting conventions in regards to where to put spaces, and where not to put spaces too! Dr Racket knows how to evaluate (+(+ 1 2)3), ( + ( + 1 2) 3), and (+ (+ 1 2 ) 3 ). But in the formatting conventions we are using, we want spaces as in (+ (+ 1 2) 3).
